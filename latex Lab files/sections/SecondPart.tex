\section{Second Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The lectures are interesting and informative, and I like the extra reading and resources given in and out of the lectures. One suggestion for improvement is to give a thorough explanation of the things that we hve to cover in the assessed labs.
\subsection{Selfie with Max}

%To include an image, you will need to remove the comments from the code below, place an image in the main folder, and do not forget to put the name of the image instead of ImgName. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Selfie with Max}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{selfie.jpg}
\label{fig:selfie}
\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref.$ you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

%My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
%This is some random text.
I have learned many things in this module including how to make requirements and specifications. In particular, I have learned how to make things such as personas, identifying stakeholders, making user stories and making use case diagrams. Overall, this has helped me understand and apply the practices of software engineers.
