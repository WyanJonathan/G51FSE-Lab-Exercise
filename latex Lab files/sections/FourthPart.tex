\section{Fourth Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
This module is entertaining, but I am not a fan of writing reports, since I think all the fun in computer science is mainly in programming.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\end{figure}

You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

 My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie4}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I have learned how to write requirements and specifications for a software project, as well as the collaborative tool Git.
