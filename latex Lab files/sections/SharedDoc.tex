\section{Shared Part}

This could be the Shared Part of the document. It is designed to be written by all members of the team.

Each member should ideally write their details in the table of contributors in the Shared Part of the document.



\subsection{Comments from the second student}
%This is the first subsection. Do not forget to include the best parts about the module as well as what you did not like about Max Wilson during the term.
Best part: the lectures. Very enjoyable and informative. 
\subsection{Comments from the third student}
CONFLICT!

\subsection{Comments from the forth student}
This module is entertaining, but I am not a fan of writing reports, since I think all the fun in computer science is mainly in programming.

\subsection{Table of Contributors}


If you want to move a table around you will need to put some parameters in square brackets, if you want it exactly where it is positioned in the text editor just uncomment the [h] below, just after begin{table}

This is the table of contributors (Table~\ref{authors}):
\begin{table}%[h]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
